# Election-Analysis
 Utilizing knowledge of Python functions and logistics to garner specific results for an election audit.



## Overview of Project
Utilizing a .csv file given to us about voter information in a U.S election, we made use of "for loops" and "conditional statements", along with other advanced syntax, to present specific information about a local election audit.  Specifically, we were taxed with writing a Python script that, when executed, would give us a neat wall of text describing voter turnout per county and which candidate in the election recieved the greatest number of votes along with general information about most of the variables.

## Election Audit Results

### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
### Which county had the largest number of votes?
### Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
### Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?



## Summary


### In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
